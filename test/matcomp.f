        subroutine materr(m,n,a,b,errmax,errrms)
c
c       calculates the relative maximum and root-mean-square errors
c       corresponding to how much a and b differ.

c       input:

c
c       displays a real rectangular matrix a via prini,
c       with the first index of a ascending as you read the rows
c       from left to right,
